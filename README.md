## Introduction

>I can see pretty easily what other people consider "good" an' "evil," and tell the difference, but I just don't understand why people get so concerned about doin' one or the other. Strikes me that the wisest thing to do is whatever the wisest thing is for whatever situation you're in, not whatever you've decided is some overarchin' truth. So I do "good" if I can profit and "evil" if I can profit and I won't get caught, and the hells can take the hindermost for all that I care which is which.

Dace Linton is a Chaotic Neutral human female bounty hunter, about 33 years old. She will come over and speak to your PC if you leave or enter through the lower archway of Waukeen's Promenade, where you can find her standing on the steps.

## Dace Linton

Dace is a slight, wiry woman with short brown hair and clothing of a decidedly nondescript colour and practical cut. She speaks in an unremarkable contralto voice, clipping some words strangely and finishing others with a slight lilt. She has a somewhat crooked grin, as though some emotion other than amusement always manages to twist her smile slightly at the last minute. Dace seems very fond of the notion of practicality but doesn't always practice what she preaches, and occasionally shows a streak of whimsicality that borders on ridiculousness. Ninety percent of the time she is operating on Full-Sarcastic, Half-Obnoxious mode, but she is also capable of brief moments of unique insight and kindness.

### Biography

> When asked about her past, Dace grins and launches into a meandering tale, punctuating it with wry facial expressions and rueful laughter.  Raised by her mother and father on a horse farm outside of Harrowdale Town, she grew up enjoying a rough-and-tumble lifestyle and animal husbandry with her sister, Everdeen.  When her father died and her mother sold their beloved horse farm, however, Dace had a falling out with her mother and sister and struck out on her own.  She learned her trade and made her own way in the world, but still visited her family occasionally.  There seems to have been some trouble after her sister married, however--a dalliance by Dace with the husband in question--and Dace now considers the bridges to her family largely burned.
>
> Dace does not seem to take any of this too seriously, as though she finds it more amusing than anything, but she does admit that she is mellowing as she ages.  Her fondest dream, which she will enthusiastically talk about, is to purchase her father's old horse farm and some stock from his lines and to continue his legacy.
>
> She is open and honest, if irreverent, about her past with her family, and is always happy to share one of her zany and usually off-color stories from her line of work. Still, her chattering has a note of deflection about it, as though there are aspects of her life she would rather not discuss.  Dace has a somewhat crooked grin, as though some emotion other than amusement always manages to twist her smile slightly at the last minute, but she generally maintains her laid-back and practical attitude.
